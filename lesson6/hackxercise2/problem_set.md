## Hackxercise 2

Within the following codeboard we prepared a pcap file for you - that is, a traffic capture file collected by [wireshark](https://www.wireshark.org/). Your task is to process this file, and **extract the source MAC address of the 3rd captured packet.**

To do this, you should use the `scapy` python package, which can process pcap files (among many other things it can do).

You can read the scapy documentation [here](https://scapy.net/).
